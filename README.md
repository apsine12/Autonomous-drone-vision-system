AUTONOMOUS DRONE VISION SYSTEM

A simple computer vision system for drones that identifies objects and follows paths.

ABOUT

This is a project made by Sunref and gm64x for the Computer Vision class.

DESCRIPTION

This project implements computer vision algorithms on a drone to:

Detect and classify objects in real-time
Identify paths in the environment
Navigate autonomously by following these paths
The system processes video feed from the drone's camera to recognize objects such as vehicles, buildings, people, and obstacles. Using edge detection and path recognition algorithms, it can identify walkways, roads, or designated routes and guide the drone to follow them while avoiding detected obstacles.
