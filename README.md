#Autonomous drone Vision system
1. Core Components:
Cameras/Sensors: Typically includes RGB cameras, depth cameras, LiDAR, infrared, or thermal sensors for environment sensing.

Onboard Computer: Processes sensor data in real-time using specialized hardware like NVIDIA Jetson or Qualcomm Snapdragon platforms.

Software Algorithms: AI and computer vision algorithms perform object detection, tracking, navigation, and obstacle avoidance.


2. Key Functionalities

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM): Enables the drone to build a map of an unknown environment while keeping track of its position.

Object Detection and Recognition: Identifies objects (like humans, vehicles, buildings) using deep learning models.

Path Planning and Navigation: Determines optimal flight paths while avoiding obstacles.

Autonomous Decision Making: Uses data from the vision system to make real-time flight decisions.
